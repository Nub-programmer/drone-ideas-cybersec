## IDEA 2: Multi-Sensor Environmental Mapping Drone
============================================

### Overview:
An autonomous drone designed for environmental data collection and real-time analysis using multiple sensors to monitor air quality, weather patterns, and terrain mapping.

### Main CPU:
Raspberry Pi Zero 2W as main controller with ESP32-P4 for sensor data aggregation and real-time processing

### Sensor Suite:
- Environmental sensors: PM2.5, PM10, CO2, temperature, humidity
- Weather sensors: barometer, anemometer, rain detection
- GPS and altitude tracking
- Multispectral camera for vegetation analysis
- LIDAR for terrain mapping

### Data Collection Features:
- Autonomous flight patterns (grid, spiral, waypoint-based)
- Real-time data logging and cloud transmission
- Edge processing for immediate insights
- Data visualization dashboard
- Statistical analysis of environmental trends

### Communication System:
- LoRa for long-range data relay
- WiFi mesh for local area monitoring
- 4G/LTE module for remote areas (optional)
- Encrypted data transmission

### AI Capabilities:
- Anomaly detection in sensor readings
- Predictive environmental modeling
- Automated alert system for critical values
- Pattern recognition for trend analysis

### Build Versions:
- Budget: ₹20,000-25,000 (Basic sensors + ESP32)
- Advanced: ₹40,000-55,000 (Full sensor suite + Raspberry Pi)
- Professional: ₹60,000-85,000 (Multispectral + 4G + advanced analytics)

### Best For:
Environmental research, air quality monitoring, weather studies, precision agriculture, disaster assessment
