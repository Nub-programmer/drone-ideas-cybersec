## IDEA 3: Autonomous Delivery & Payload Drone
============================================

### Overview:
A heavy-lifting autonomous drone designed for payload delivery, package transport, and cargo missions with focus on reliability and efficiency.

### Main CPU:
ESP32-P4 with optional Raspberry Pi for complex mission planning and obstacle avoidance

### Frame & Motor Design:
- Hexacopter or octocopter configuration for stability and payload capacity
- High-torque brushless motors (800-1000KV range)
- Carbon fiber frame with modular payload bay
- Quick-release mechanisms for rapid delivery
- Reinforced landing gear

### Payload Capabilities:
- Modular cargo compartment (500g-2kg capacity depending on version)
- Automated door/hatch release system
- Weight distribution balancing system
- Waterproof enclosure for sensitive items

### Autonomous Features:
- GPS-based waypoint navigation
- Obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic/infrared sensors
- Collision detection and emergency landing
- Automated takeoff and landing sequences
- Geofencing for safety boundaries

### Navigation & Planning:
- Route optimization algorithm
- Real-time obstacle detection
- Mission re-planning capabilities
- Weather condition assessment
- Battery management for extended range

### Communication:
- 4G/LTE module for real-time tracking
- LoRa backup communication
- Live video feed from onboard cameras
- Ground control station with mission planner

### Safety Features:
- Redundant failsafe systems
- Emergency parachute deployment option
- Real-time health monitoring
- Geofence enforcement
- Return-to-home on signal loss

### Build Versions:
- Budget: ₹25,000-35,000 (Quadcopter, 300g payload)
- Advanced: ₹45,000-60,000 (Hexacopter, 1kg payload, obstacle avoidance)
- Professional: ₹70,000-100,000 (Octocopter, 2kg payload, redundant systems)

### Best For:
Last-mile delivery, emergency supply transport, agricultural payload delivery, search & rescue operations
